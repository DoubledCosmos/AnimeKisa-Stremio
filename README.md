# Anime-Kisa-Stremio

An addon for stremio allowing for Anime Kisa sources

Based on https://github.com/Stremio/addon-helloworld-express

Since AnimeKisa has proven to have anime when many other sites do not (including stremio with every single existing
anime addon), I decided to make this.

It should be noted that AnimeKisa does not have a public API, so I scraped one from their regular HTML site - which is
obviously less efficient than it could be, so I'll work to make sure it only needs to happen once (Everything will be
cached)
